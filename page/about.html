                <h3>MY STORY</h3>
        
                Hi, my name is Juan Ignacio Cabrales and I'm from Aberdeen in the north east of Scotland, I studied 3D Design at Gray's School of Art in the city, specialising in metalwork and enamel. After graduating in 1995, I spent a few years in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter working as a designer-jeweller before starting a family and moving back to Scotland. While bringing up my children, circumstances didn't allow me to work in metal and enamel, so I worked with paper and photography instead, making handmade notebooks and stationery, and always drawing. I have recently been able to return to silversmithing and enamelling and after being based in the Vanilla Ink Studios in Glasgow for over two years, I am now back in Aberdeen and have my own workshop in Deemouth Artist Studios in Torry.

                <h3>MY PROCESS</h3>
        
                My work begins in the landscape, taking photos of the huge Scottish skies, paying attention to the intersection of land, sky and sea. The big clouds, dramatic weather and gradients in the sky all contribute to the watercolour paintings I produce back at home.  I love to see land hidden in mist and rain, or sun bursting through a cloud - these details, the subtle differences in tones and colours, are all important. I then reference these paintings when working with the enamel, using jewellery enamel along with powdered painting enamel to produce an effect similar to my paintings. I'm trying to evoke the feeling of the landscape and the sky without reproducing it exactly. The colours I use are natural, muted - those found in nature, colours of the sky, sea and land and the contrasts between them. Similarly I highlight the contrasts between the enamel and the metal in my work.
        
                The shapes I work with are taken from the many drawings I do of flowers and plants. The current collection is mostly shapes of hydrangea flowers and eucalyptus leaves which are a joy to draw - not quite round, not quite oval, something in between with beautiful soft curves. 
        
                No two pieces that I make are exactly the same, I love the spontaneity that comes from experimenting with the enamel, it's deliberately different every time as in nature and with the weather â€“ similar but different. Working from the drawings and paintings of nature and landscape, the pieces develop as they are being made. I don't work to detailed technical drawings for each design. The bowls and vessels grow from the metal in a very organic way, when it feels right it's done.
        
                I love to collaborate, so if you have an idea of a particular landscape that you'd love to see rendered in enamel then do get in touch.</p>

                <h3>MATERIALS</h3>
        
                Enamelling is the ancient process of fusing coloured glass, which has usually been ground to a powder, onto metal such as silver or gold at around 800 degrees centigrade. It can be transparent or opaque, I tend to use more opaque enamel in my work to achieve the effects I want, using fine silver or copper as a contrast.
